# MicroLife

A simple and non-optimized implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://pentadecathlon.com/lifeNews/) for the SparkFun MicroView.

## Requirements and Installation

The code won't be particularly useful unless you have a [SparkFun MicroView](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12923), a combination Arduino and OLED display.

## Documentation and Contact Information

Documentation (such that there is) can be found in the [source code](https://github.com/profburke/microlife/YYY).

The best way to contact me regarding this library is to post an issue at the [github repository](https://github.com/profburke/microlife/issues).
